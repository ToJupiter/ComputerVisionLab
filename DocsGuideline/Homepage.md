All of these things must be written in just the docs markdown type in Vietnamese. Focus on making the text short and minimal as possible. These will be 3 pages so 3 separate markdowns. Use multiple icons and short boxes.


################## Guideline for prompting 
Read the whole pdf and take out every single formula and important knowledge from it. For every knowledge, take from the book an exercise/example. Solve them and make that example the demonstration of the formulas in the book. Everything should be taken from the book instead of finding new knowledge. Translate it to Vietnamese, return in the form of latex markdown. Note that every math formula must be written in double $$, instead of $. For example, x = 10 must be written in "$$ x = 10 $$" instead of "$ x = 10 $". Every Vietnamese block must have easy to understand text but not too long. Focus on tailoring the text. Please use all of the good ones in the provided pdfs, because every concept is important and crucial. Return your response as normal, just keep in mind this rule: Note that every math formula must be written in double $$, instead of $. For example, x = 10 must be written in "$$ x = 10 $$" instead of "$ x = 10 $".
